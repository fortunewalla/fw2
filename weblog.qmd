Some books I have read are:

    All of Statistics by Larry Wasserman (2005). He has a bazillion typos, and he does not really prove any of his theorems (I understand that since this is a birds eye view of all of statistics).

    In all likelihood by Yudi Pawitan (2001). I liked it somewhat but I felt he talks about too many properties that he does not really prove specially about the MLE which is quite bad since the book is all about MLE and likelihood.

    Mathematical Statistics and Data Analysis by John A. Rice (1995). I like it a lot but this is univariate only. Ideally, I would love something like this multivariate and updated to more recent developments.

    Introduction to Statistical Learning by James, Whittens, Hastie and Tibshirani (2013). This was an excellent intuition-only book with lots of R code. I know of its predecessor ESL but somehow I did not like that one. It pretends to be a mathematical book but it intentionally omits proofs and it often used a lot of theory that was not precisely referenced so I am looking for reference.

I also started reading:

    Multivariate Analysis by Kardia, Kent, Bibby (1979). This is last one is almost exactly what I am looking for except this one feels old since it is already 42 years since originally published.

    If you had a strong undergraduate student who was interested in learning about various multivariate methods (e.g. PCA, MANOVA, discriminant analysis, ...) is there a good, accessible book you might recommend she/he purchase?

Here are the responses:

    Perhaps "Applied Multivariate Data Analysis", 2nd edition, by Everitt, B. and Dunn, G. (2001), published by Arnold. [Roger Johnson]

    Rencher's Methods of Multivariate Analysis is a great resource. I think a strong undergraduate student could grasp the material. [Philip Yates]. I'm fond of Rencher's approach. He offers good intuition and examples. But the matrix algebra can get pretty thick; I'm not sure "accessible" is an adjective I'd use. Nevertheless, I've taught undergrads successfully with his book. His second edition is a good improvement over the first. [Paul Velleman]

    Applied Multivariate Statistics by Johnson and Wichern. [Brad Hartlaub]

    I haven't done much with it, but I do like the idea of using modern techniques and modern data sets: Modern Multivariate Statistical Techniques by Alan Julian Izenman. (I own the book, it has the topics you are looking for, and the text seems accessible.) [Johanna Hardin]

    (+1) I like the first, and especially the last one (pretty much the same as the Elements of Statistical Learning, by Hastie and coll., but with other examples and a discussion of biplots and correspondence analysis).
